# testing measuRing

library(measuRing)

# load image
img <- "IMG_5932_1.tiff"

# first pass
dt_1 <- ringDetect(img, segs = 3, ppi = 375.9)

# pretty good, but many false positives and negatives present

# second try with increased contrast and brightness
img1 <- "IMG_5932_2.tiff"

dt_2 <- ringDetect(img1, segs = 3, ppi = 375.9)

# arguably worse

# this is because i'm using an iphone and not a scanner, measuRing will need to be tuned to what the iphone sees
# ppi calculations could be wrong also. the ruler and the sample do not sit on the same plane

# some solutions wouid include: fine tuning in the gui that lets you edit the detected ring boundaries
# or use imageTogray() first to create the gray matrix outside of the ringDetect()

img_gray <- imageTogray(img, ppi = 375.9)

dt_3 <- ringDetect(img_gray, segs = 3)

# nothing changes, let's use the gui

dt_4 <- ringDetect(img, segs = 5, ppi = 375.9)

dt_4 <- ringSelect(dt_4)
